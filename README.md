# GoChat
Simple CLI chat application written in Go

## About  
This application is my first application written in Go. The goal was to use my newly acquired Go training and create a simple CLI application with it. The source code in my opinion is quite a mess tho.

## Building the server and client  
```
git clone https://github.com/WoutDev/GoChat
cd GoChat
```

### Server
```
cd .\src\github.com\woutdev\gochat\server
go build server.go
```

### Client
(navigate back to the project root if you just builded the server)
```
cd .\src\github.com\woutdev\gochat\client
go build client.go
```
